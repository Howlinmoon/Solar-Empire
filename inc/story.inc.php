<p>In the year 2092, one hundred and twenty five years after the momentus
Apollo 11 mission to the moon, the four-member crew of the Starship Excelsior
became the first the first humans to travel to another star system. The
celebrations and excitement on Earth were intense, to say the least. Wild
parties were thrown which taxed the resources of police departments around
the world, the media was caught up in a frenzied coverage of the event,
politicians praised their own efforts and Jonathon Browning, a nondescript
technician at the sprawling SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)
Institute in Arizona received the first communication from an alien species.</p>
<p>The United Nations was aghast at the message. Humanity shared a collective
sense of rage and indignation. Far from the over-popularised demand of
&quot;Take me to your leader&quot;, the message was a polite but obviously
threatening warning, advising mankind never to leave the Solar System again or
risk war with a technologically advanced alien species. After months of heated
debate and political manoeuvring, the reply was broadcast into deep space, a
challenging request that the aliens mind their own business and steer clear of
our expansion into the galaxy.</p>
<p>The response of the aliens was swift and horribly brutal. A fleet of
streamlined starships began to orbit the Earth a few weeks later.  Without
provocation or a hint of warning, they proceeded to pound into rubble the proud
capital cities of the world powers. The resulting chaos plunged Earth into a
new Dark Age.</p>
<p>Economies stalled and crashed, countries descended into mayhem and war,
famine was widespread and the situation was exacerbated by the accidental
launch of a handful of nuclear missiles from various locations around the globe.
Fighting against war, famine, long-forgotten diseases, radioactive hotspots and
economic ruin, it took almost ten years for a new order to emerge, one ruled by
the iron-fisted influence of the new age Corporations.</p>
<p>Gradually order returned to the world under the control of the Corporations.
But a fatal shortage of food and raw resources was the only stumbling block to
their domination of the planet. Research into space travel was resurrected. In
the New Age economies, private companies and entrepreneurs invested funds into
the research and slowly a gradual process of integration and alliances gave
birth to the first Clans, great organisations that encompassed Corporations,
their allies and entire populations. The dawning of the first Warp Engine Drive,
combining old Ion Propulsion Engines with experimental Wormhole technology,
acted as a catalyst to speed up the development of spaceships capable of
instantaneous interstellar travel.</p>
<p>Earth became cluttered with dozens of orbiting Manufacturing Stations
churning out advanced spacecraft to serve the needs of the Clans. Freighters,
Battleships, Harvester ships for mining, Colony ships and single-pilot Fighters
were built as well as a host of other exotic starships. Rivalry and competition
resulted in spates of sabotage and industrial espionage as the Clans fought for
supremacy of the new technologies that were being developed day by day.</p>
<p>In 2123, the first interstellar starships left the Sol system and expanded
the reach of the Clans to other star systems. These early exploratory missions
were to act as the platform from which to launch an all out assault on the
galaxy. Star Systems were mapped and explored for signs of fuel or metals,
whether from meteorites or planets. Aliens were encountered but the tables had
turned: our fleets of advanced spacecraft were able to repel many of the
attacks. The alien species were many. New alliances and peace treaties were
signed but the aggressiveness and savagery of other extraterrestrial species
led to many attacks and raids.</p>
<p>As mankind continued the expansion, rivalry and competition took a further
step and fuelled wars and arguments between the Clans. Soon all out war was to
ready erupt, Clans allied themselves with others and in time not even the Sol
System was safe from attacks and raids by rival Clan members.</p>
<p>The year is now 2126. The Clans and individuals have agreed that this will
be the year that humanity will at long last colonise the galaxy. A new age has
dawned for mankind, an age of interstellar travel, Clan wars, extraterrestrial
races and alien raids, an age of colonisation and exploration, an age of Solar
Empires.</p>
