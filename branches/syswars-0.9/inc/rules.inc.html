<h2>Server Rules</h2>
<p>Breaking any one of these will result in either being banned from the game, 
retired from the game, or even deleted from the server!  So it's advised you 
read them carefully.</p>
<p>The game Admin's are the Final Judges of whether these rules have been broken.
Though the Server Admin has the very-final say (hey, it's our bandwidth).</p>
<ol>
	<li>Only one account per person. Under absolutely no circumstances may 
	a player have more than one account. Multiple accounts will be deleted 
	pro-actively without warning, and without the possibility of reprieve!</li>
	<li>You may not create an account for anyone other than yourself.</li>
	<li>Do not give your account password to anyone. Especially not to
	allow them to baby-sit your account. Among other reasons, giving out your 
	password can result in your account being stolen/abused. This if for your 
	protection.</li>
	<li>Absolutely <strong>no bug exploitation</strong>. If you find a bug, 
	report it to the Admin. If something doesn't behave in the way you think 
	it should, report it.</li>
	<li>Do not use a tool or program to access your account and play the game
	for you (otherwise known as a robot). Each account may only be used by
	one sentient being.</li>
	<li>Follow any specific in-game rules if there are any.</li>
	<li>Only use your account.</li>
</ol>
